                  The cost depends on a thorough assessment by our professional technician. Often, specialized equipment is needed to diagnose the issue, and some components that require attention are not visible until inspected. For this reason, giving an accurate quote over the phone is challenging. Once the technician completes the diagnosis, we can provide the exact cost based on the brand, model number, labor, and parts needed.

If a specific part is needed that we do not have on hand, our suppliers can typically provide it within 2 to 3 days, allowing us to complete the repair quickly once we receive the part.
