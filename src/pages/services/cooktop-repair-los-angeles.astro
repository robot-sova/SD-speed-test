                <ol>

                  <li>
                    <b>Prevents Build-Up and Blockages</b>

                <p>
                  Deciding whether to repair or replace your cooktop can be challenging. Here are some key factors to consider that can help you make an informed decision:
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="content__page-desc">
                <ol>

                  <li>
                    <b>Age of the Cooktop</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Typical Lifespan: Cooktops generally last between 10 to 20 years, depending on the brand, model, and how well they have been maintained.</li>
                      <li>Older Models: If your cooktop is nearing or has surpassed its typical lifespan, it might be more cost-effective to replace it rather than continuing to invest in repairs.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <b>Cost of Repairs vs. Replacement</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Repair Costs: Obtain a detailed estimate for the repair. If the repair cost is more than 50% of the price of a new cooktop, replacement might be the better option.</li>
                      <li>New Cooktop Costs: Compare the repair estimate with the cost of a new cooktop, including installation fees. Sometimes, the difference might not be substantial enough to justify repairing an old appliance.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <b>Frequency of Repairs</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Frequent Repairs: If youâve had to repair the cooktop multiple times in the past few years, it may be more economical to replace it. Continuous repairs can quickly add up and become more expensive than purchasing a new unit.</li>
                      <li>First-Time Issue: If this is the first significant problem and the cooktop has otherwise been reliable, a repair might be the best course of action.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <b>Energy Efficiency</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Older Models: Older cooktops are typically less energy-efficient than newer models. Replacing an old cooktop with a modern, energy-efficient model can save you money on energy bills in the long term.</li>
                      <li>Environmental Impact: Energy-efficient appliances are better for the environment, reducing your carbon footprint.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <b>Availability of Parts</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Discontinued Models: If your cooktop model is discontinued and parts are hard to find or expensive, replacing the cooktop might be the more practical choice.</li>
                      <li>Readily Available Parts: If parts are easily available and not too costly, repairing the cooktop could be a straightforward solution.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <b>Technological Advancements</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>New Features: Modern cooktops come with advanced features such as touch controls, induction heating, and enhanced safety features. If these advancements are important to you, upgrading to a new model might be worth considering.</li>
                      <li>Compatibility: Make sure a new model will fit in your existing kitchen space and be compatible with your kitchen setup.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <b>Safety Concerns</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Gas Leaks or Electrical Issues: If there are safety concerns such as gas leaks or recurring electrical issues, replacement is often the safest option.</li>
                      <li>Modern Safety Standards: Newer cooktops adhere to the latest safety standards, providing better peace of mind.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <b>Performance and Reliability</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Decreased Performance: If the cooktop's performance has significantly decreased and it no longer cooks food evenly or efficiently, replacement might be necessary.</li>
                      <li>Reliable Performance: If the cooktop has been generally reliable and performs well despite the issue, repairing it could extend its useful life.</li>
                    </ul>

                   <p>If you smell gas, it's crucial to take immediate and appropriate action to ensure your safety and the safety of others. Follow these steps:</p>
                   <ol>

                    <li>
                      <b>Do Not Ignite Flames or Sparks:</b>
                      <p>Avoid lighting matches, using lighters, or turning on any electrical switches (including lights, appliances, and phones) as these could ignite the gas.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <b>Ventilate the Area:</b>
                      <p>If it's safe to do so, open windows and doors to allow fresh air to disperse the gas.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <b>Evacuate:</b>
                      <p>Leave the building immediately. Do not attempt to locate the source of the gas leak yourself.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <b>Avoid Using Electronics:</b>
                      <p>Do not use any electronic devices, including cell phones, until you are at a safe distance from the suspected leak. Even a small spark from a phone can ignite gas.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <b>Shut Off the Gas Supply:</b>
                      <p>If you know how and can do so safely, turn off the gas supply at the main shutoff valve. This is often located near the gas meter outside your home.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <b>Call for Help:</b>
                      <p>Once you are at a safe distance, call your gas company's emergency number or the local fire department to report the gas leak. Use a neighborâs phone or your mobile phone once you are clear of the building.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <b>Do Not Re-enter the Building:</b>
                      <p>Do not go back inside until professionals have declared it safe to do so.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <b>Follow Professional Advice:</b>
                      <p>Listen to and follow the instructions provided by emergency personnel and gas company technicians. They will assess the situation and take appropriate action to resolve the gas leak.</p>
                    </li>

                   </ol>
                   <p>Taking these steps promptly can help prevent potentially dangerous situations and ensure everyone's safety.</p>
