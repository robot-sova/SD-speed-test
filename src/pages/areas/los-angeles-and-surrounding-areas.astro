        <h2>Dryer Repair Los Angeles</h2>

        <p>
          Dryer repair Los Angeles is one of the most frequent searches in LA
          for appliance repair needs. During the summer, dryers often overheat,
          and dust builds up faster because they are used more frequently.
          Maintenance of the dryer is your first step to its longevity. We
          recommend evaluating your dryer's exhaust pipe. If the exhaust pipe is
          longer than 6 feet, dust definitely accumulates inside your dryer
          fast. Also, if the pipe is installed incorrectly with visible twists,
          your dryer accumulates dust quickly. Accumulated dust can wear our
          moving dryer components, presenting a health and fire hazard. We
          recommend having your dryer professionally cleaned once a year and
          twice a year if you have pets. We understand the health hazards and
          fire hazards of a dusty dryer. This is why each dryer repair at our
          appliance repair company comes with a free professional dryer cleaning
          service.
