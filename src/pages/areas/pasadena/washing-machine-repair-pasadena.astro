                Regular maintenance is essential for your washing machine’s
                longevity and optimal performance. We recommend annual
                maintenance, which involves inspecting hoses and connections,
                cleaning the drum, filter, and detergent dispenser, checking the
                door seal and water inlet filters, balancing the machine,
                running a diagnostic test, inspecting electrical components,
                lubricating moving parts, and listening for unusual noises to
                ensure efficient operation and extend the machine's lifespan.
                Our flat fee for this comprehensive service is $80. This
                preventive approach not only saves you money by reducing the
                need for repairs but also enhances the efficiency and lifespan
                of your appliance. Schedule your maintenance appointment with us
                today and ensure your washing machine runs smoothly.

              <p>
                See prices below. The cost of labor depends on the complexity of
                the washing machine repair and the estimated time required. We
                ensure transparency by providing a detailed quote before you
                commit to the service. Should the repair take longer than
                expected, you won't be charged extra; we waive the diagnostic
                fee upon proceeding with the repair, ensuring no surprises on
                your bill.

                See prices below. While not every repair needs new parts,
                certain situations require them to restore your washing machine
                to peak performance. Our technicians carry various parts in
                their vehicles, which usually enables same-day repairs. If a
                part must be ordered, the cost will vary depending on your
                washing machine's repair, brand, and model. We always do our
                best to find parts at a lower price for our customers. We do not
                make extra money on the parts; our priority is to make it as
                easy as possible for the customer.

            <li>
              <b> Check for Obstructions:</b> Small objects like coins or buttons
              can get trapped in the drum or filter. Remove any visible obstructions
              to see if that fixes the noise issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Inspect the Drum:</b> Make sure the drum is not overloaded or unbalanced.
              Uneven loads can cause loud noises during the spin cycle.

            If your washing machine won't start, several issues could be causing
            this problem. Here are a few common reasons and potential solutions:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b> Power Supply Issues:</b> Ensure that the washer is properly plugged
              in and there is no electrical outlet issue. Sometimes, a simple reset
              of your circuit breaker can fix the issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Door/Lid Switch:</b> The washer might not start if the door or lid
              switch is faulty. Check to make sure the door is fully closed and latched
              properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Control Panel Problems:</b> The control panel might be malfunctioning.
              If the buttons or display are unresponsive, this might require professional
              appliance repair.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Motor Issues:</b> The motor could be defective, especially if you
              hear a humming noise, but the washer won't start.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Other Electrical Issues:</b> Faulty wiring or other internal electrical
              issues could also be the culprit.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Washing Machine:</b> Ideally, you should get your washing machine
                serviced once a year. Regular maintenance will help prevent issues
                and keep it running smoothly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Dishwasher:</b> Like your washing machine, your dishwasher should
                be serviced annually to maintain its efficiency and prolong its lifespan.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Refrigerator:</b> Your refrigerator should be serviced three times
                over its lifetime. Depending on its age and usage, this typically
                means once every few years.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Dryer:</b> Your dryer requires more frequent attention, with a
                recommended service interval of every 7 times you use it. This is
                crucial for preventing fire hazards and ensuring it dries your clothes
                effectively.

                <b>Viking Appliances:</b> If you have Viking appliances, such as
                a range or oven, you should follow the manufacturer’s guidelines
                for servicing. Generally, high-end appliances like Viking benefit

                Yes, it is necessary to service your appliances even if they
                work fine. Regular maintenance is crucial for a few reasons:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b> Preventative Maintenance:</b> Servicing your appliances regularly
                  can catch potential issues early before they become major problems.
                  For instance, even if your refrigerator seems to be working well,
                  servicing it three times over its lifetime can help maintain its
                  efficiency and prevent unexpected breakdowns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Efficiency:</b> Appliances not regularly maintained can operate
                  less efficiently, leading to higher energy consumption and increased
                  utility bills. For example, a dryer should be serviced every 4
                  times you use it to ensure it dries your clothes effectively and
                  safely.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Longevity:</b> Regular servicing extends the lifespan of your
                  appliances. By adhering to maintenance schedules—like servicing
                  your refrigerator three times and your dryer every 4 uses—you can
                  significantly prolong their operational life, saving you money
                  in the long run.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Safety:</b> Regular maintenance is crucial for safety, especially
                  with appliances like dryers. A poorly maintained dryer can pose
                  a fire hazard due to lint buildup.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                In summary, even if your appliances seem to be working fine,
                regular servicing is essential to ensure they remain efficient,
                safe, and long-lasting.

            <div class="questions">
              <p>
                When installing new appliances, there are several important
                factors to consider to ensure they operate efficiently and
                safely:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Professional Installation:</b> While some appliances are straightforward
                  to install, others may require professional expertise. For instance,
                  complex appliances like a dryer should ideally be installed by
                  a professional to ensure all connections are secure and the appliance
                  is set up correctly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Manufacturer’s Guidelines:</b> Always follow the manufacturer’s
                  installation instructions closely. These guidelines are designed
                  to ensure the appliance operates safely and efficiently. Ignoring
                  them could void your warranty or lead to operational issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Proper Placement:</b> Ensure the appliance is placed appropriately.
                  For example, a dryer needs to be positioned with proper ventilation
                  to avoid overheating and maintain efficiency. Incorrect placement
                  can lead to performance issues and potential safety hazards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Electrical and Plumbing Requirements:</b> Check that your home’s
                  electrical and plumbing systems can support the new appliance.
                  For example, a dryer will need the correct electrical outlet and
                  possibly a venting system. Ensuring compatibility can prevent damage
                  to the appliance and your home’s infrastructure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Future Maintenance:</b> Consider the ease of access for future
                  maintenance. For instance, if you need to fix your dryer three
                  times over its lifetime, having it easily accessible can make these
                  service visits less of a hassle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Space and Dimensions:</b> Measure the space where you plan to
                  install the appliance to ensure it fits properly. This is particularly
                  important for larger appliances like refrigerators and dryers,
                  as an improper fit can lead to operational issues and inefficiencies.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Considering these factors, you can ensure your new appliances
                are installed correctly and set up for optimal performance and
                longevity.
