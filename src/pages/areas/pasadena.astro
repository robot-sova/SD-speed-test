      <p>
        Properly maintaining your appliances is crucial for their performance
        and overall durability. Consistent upkeep such as cleaning, debris
        removal, and damage inspection can significantly improve the
        effectiveness and lifespan of your appliances. To ensure their
        reliability and longevity, it is recommended to have them professionally
        serviced annually especially when it comes to dryers. Dryers have a
        tendency to accumulate dust that prevents moving components from
        functioning properly. It is important to have your dryer cleaned
        professionally one a year and twice a year if you have pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are various methods that can be implemented to optimize the
        functioning of your Home appliances.
      </p>
      <p>&bull; Insuring proper unit installation according to the manual</p>
      <p>&bull; Removing dust from refrigerator coils promptly</p><p>
        &bull; Adjusting oven temperature settings according to the manual
      </p>
      <p>&bull; Regularly cleaning filters in your units</p>
      <p>&bull; Not overloading washers and dryers</p>
      <p>
        &bull; Using appliance with care, not slamming doors or pushing buttons
        hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; Moving the unit carefully if needed without damaging outer parts
        such as pipes
      </p>
      <p>
        &bull; In case of detecting strange issues don't delay the repair
        because it can cause further costly damage
      </p>
      <p>&bull; Use services only from trusted and licensed companies.</p>
      <p>
        By implementing these measures consistently, you can avoid costly
        repairs in the future while keeping all essential information intact

        Fast and Affordable Washer and Dryer Solutions in Pasadena, CA
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the event that your important Home appliances, such as your washer or
        dryer, stop working properly, what can you do? At Reliable Appliance
        Repair Pasadena, we offer cost-effective and efficient solutions for any
        issues with your washer or dryer. Our skilled technicians are
        well-equipped to handle a variety of problems ranging from water supply
        shortages in washing machines to common malfunctions like door switch
        failures, timer issues and control board breakdowns in dryers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every dryer we fix comes with free and professional dust cleaning
        service. It is crucial to professionally clean your dryer once a year
        and twice a year if you have pets. If your dryer hav't been cleaned for
        over a year, it presents a fire hazard and health hazard. A "dust
        blanket" is formed on the inside of the dryer, around moving components
        and near the flame. This can result in moving components breaking down
        causing you having to repair the dryer in the best scenario and in a
        house fire in the worst. Lint can also escape the dryer polluting your
        indoor air.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strive to schedule same-day or next-day appointments based on part
