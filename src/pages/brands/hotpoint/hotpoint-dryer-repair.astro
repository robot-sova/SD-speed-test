      <h2>Common Hotpoint Dryer Issues and Our Repair Solutions</h2>
      <p  ><strong>Hotpoint dryers</strong> are known for their affordability and straightforward
        design, but like any appliance, they can experience common issues over time. Some of the most frequent problems
        include <strong>heating element failures</strong>, which prevent the dryer from reaching the correct temperature, and
        <strong>thermal fuse malfunctions</strong>, which may stop the dryer from turning on altogether. <strong>Blower wheel
          problems</strong>, <strong>belt issues</strong>, and <strong>motor failures</strong> can also lead to extended
        drying times or complete shutdowns. Additionally, <strong>control board malfunctions</strong> and <strong>sensor
          issues</strong> can cause improper drying cycles or leave your dryer unresponsive.</p>
